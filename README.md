# marios_bong

Capatability:
Windows operating system

What files do I need to run the game?

You can do this two different ways:

1. (IF YOU JUST WANT TO RUN THE GAME) Download the project.exe file and just run it:
   This is used to directly run the program without directly putting the code into your IDE, but if you do not have visual studios I        believe you may have some features missing in the game, such as sound (I could be wrong though, just try it).

2. (UPLOADING CODE INTO YOUR IDE AND RUN FROM THERE, OR CUSTOMIZING THE GAME) Download mario3.cpp and add an existing item to your IDE:
   Right click on the source file in the IDE and add existing item (mario3.cpp), then debug, or customize the game 
   
I will update this read me file later with some ways to customize the game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

How to play the game:
use keys i = up,k = down, j = left and l = right to get to marios bong so he can smoke.
